### 🗃️ Spaces

Spaces are places for individuals, teams, and companies to organize and work on ideas, projects, documentation, and announcements. Spaces can be customized and integrated with both Atlassian tools and others. [Create](https://confluence.atlassian.com/conf73/create-a-space-991927526.html) as many spaces as you need to get things done:

#### team spaces

Give each team their own space so they can work closely and make information easier to find.


![](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:d692981e-d32e-43db-b254-78d559506044/getting_started_project_spaces.png)
#### project spaces

Put all the information related to your project in one place so everyone can work together.


![](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:0f2d114f-2bde-43a3-8ba5-c1fc80372f01/getting_started_personal_spaces.png)
#### personal spaces

Store anything you’re working on, keep your to-do lists, and polish content before moving it into a shared space.



- [ ] **In the main navigation bar, select `Spaces` → `Create space` to create a new space.**

[More about spaces](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/guides/get-started/set-up)





### 📄 Content

**Whiteboards** are your team’s place to brainstorm, build connections, and make ideas come to life.

**Pages** are the building blocks of Confluence. Drop ideas into a page, to collaborate on, refine, and document work.

**Blog posts** are individually-authored pieces of content that illustrate a particular perspective, typically shared broadly—great for documenting case studies or broad insights.



<div class="table-container">
<table ac:local-id="819214bc-5025-4c16-ac18-b044a30aac4c" data-layout="default"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="" src="https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/misc-assets/webp-images/content_gif_v1.0.2.webp"/></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>

To create a content within a space, select the `+` and choose your content type. You can also create content using the `Create` button in the main navigation bar.



- [ ] **Press `c` to create content at any time.**

## Making purposeful content





### ✏️ Confluence editor

Changes can only be made to page content when in the editor. Changes will save automatically and be pushed live the next time the page is published.


### 🛠️ Templates

If you’re not sure where to start when setting up a new space or content, save time with a template.



<div class="table-container">
<table ac:local-id="4ee70410-a2f8-4c13-a4ee-25f5db543a3a" data-layout="default"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="" src="https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:253dd176-da3b-49da-8436-7cba38aadf33/getting_started_purposeful_content.png"/></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>



- [ ] **Press `e` when on a page to open the editor.**

[More about templates](https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/create-a-page-from-a-template) | [Browse space templates](https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/create-a-space-from-a-template/)





### 🧰 Elements

Elements are tools like calendars, note panels, and layouts, designed to help you make your content more powerful.



<div class="table-container">
<table ac:local-id="c6400d5b-e824-4e8b-bd99-7036ad12185f" data-layout="default"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="" src="https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:e560606b-00c4-46e6-8e8e-87b4cc48e655/getting_started_elements.gif"/></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>



- [ ] **Press `/` to see a list of elements.**

[More about elements](https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/create-a-space-from-a-template)





### 📸 Header images

Make your content more visually impactful with emojis and header images. 🍕 Emojis aren’t just a fun way to spice up your content—they also show up in search, so using them strategically makes it easier to find content later on.





<div class="table-container">
<table ac:local-id="a03f7e89-c535-470b-81f7-0826ed5d797e" data-layout="default"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="" src="https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:f58ddedc-3639-4fd9-afcc-7dc7362b90e6/getting_started_header_images.gif"/></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>



- [ ] **Select `Add status` at the top of the page, so teammates can see your progress at a glance.**

## Collaborating with teammates


### 🧑‍💻 Real-time editing

You and up to 11 teammates can edit a page together in real time. Changes save and sync automatically so that everyone editing sees the same thing. Start editing together by selecting the **Edit** icon in the header.


<div class="table-container">
<table ac:local-id="9b893293-49ca-4e08-b0fc-6d702ae185ac" data-layout="default"><colgroup><col style="width: 760.0px;"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td data-highlight-colour="#fffae6"><img alt="" src="https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:2de2caaf-8024-4244-aed7-b3995e7ff3bd/getting_started_realtime_editing.gif"/></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>


- [ ] **Press `Command + Enter` when in the editor to publish.**

[More about collaborative editing](https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/create-edit-and-publish-a-page/#Collaborative-editing)


### 💬 Mentions and comments

Comments are a great way to start a conversation about a page or blog post. They allow you to remark on content, add important information, ask questions, and generally drive collaboration and teamwork.

@mention a teammate to bring them into the conversation, and they can reply to and/or like comments.


<div class="table-container">
<table ac:local-id="4fc4332a-417b-403a-87e1-5c5b62392a52" data-layout="default"><colgroup><col style="width: 680.0px;"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td data-highlight-colour="#e6fcff"><img alt="" src="https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:227fea49-b5b6-4a01-921e-1931f7919848/getting_started_mentions_and_comments.gif"/></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>

## Organizing your content





### 🌳 Content tree

The content tree is where your content is organized within a space. Drag and drop to reorder or nest content, so you can more effectively share your work with others.


![](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:667561bb-2450-4179-a333-b797a847fceb/getting_started_page_tree.gif)

- [ ] **After you publish, select `[` to expand or collapse the content tree.**

[More about the content tree](https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/move-copy-and-hide-pages/)





### 📣 Space overview

To help your teammates find relevant content, curate your space overview with useful elements like calendars and content statuses, and include information about what is in your space.


![](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:81fe1309-530c-48b6-9f26-7a75273e710e/getting_started_space_overview.png)

- [ ] **Use the `/info` panel element to highlight important information in your space overview.**

[More about space overview](https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/set-up-your-space-homepage/)


### 🌻 Content types


![](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/misc-assets/webp-images/template-brainwriting-theme-white-v2.svg)**WHITEBOARD**


###### If your content still isn’t defined, whiteboards are a quick way to get messy ideas from many collaborators documented.


![](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/misc-assets/webp-images/template-blogpost.webp)**BLOG POST**


###### If your content that won’t change over time, create it as a blog post. The blog feed for each space displays the most recent posts first.


![](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/misc-assets/webp-images/template-confluence-chart.webp)**PAGE**


###### If your content may change over time, create it as a page. Pages nest, so you can create categories and subcategories.



- [ ] **Press `k` for a shareable link to your page or post.**

[More about sharing content](https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/share-a-page-or-blog-post/) | [More about whiteboards](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/whiteboards)





### 📏 Tables

Tables allow you to organize important information on a page to discuss it with your team. Present the information the way it makes sense to you—resize columns, color cells, rows and columns, and sort the table by clicking the column headers.



<div class="table-container">
<table ac:local-id="672837c8-5bd8-4959-a398-e82b6c3b137b" data-layout="default"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="" src="https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:ed02879a-ec4e-4afe-b1c7-e6aff8fff8b5/getting_started_tables.gif"/></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>



- [ ] **Type `/table` to add a table at any time.**

[More about tables](https://confluence.atlassian.com/conf73/tables-991927743.html)





### 🌱 Drafts

Confluence autosaves your page as you work—if you select `Close` in the editor without publishing, you’ll create a draft, or an unpublished page you can get back to at any time.




![](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:0ab8f4c6-3406-411d-b665-eee20ed68680/getting_started_drafts.png)
draft**Only you can see your draft, unless you share a link to it.**
